Background
About Practice Problem: Identify the Digits

Automatic digit recognition is of popular interest today. Deep Learning techniques makes it possible for object recognition in image data . This practice problem is meant to give you a kick start in deep learning. As usual, we will not only provide you with the challenge and a solution checker, but also a set of tutorials to get you off the ground!

The data set used for this problem is from the populat MNIST data set. Developed by Yann LeCun, Corina Cortes and Christopher Burger for evaluating machine learning model on the handwritten digit classification problem. It is a widely used data set in the machine learning community. For more details about the data set, read [here](http://bit.ly/1REjJgL)
